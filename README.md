# Collisions
1. I have coded a collision engine program in Processing (a java animations library), my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough. You can run the code in the Processing Developement Environment (PDE) itself.  
2. It has very basic . If you find a bug you can open a pull request.
3. There are two programs included, one with gravity and one without gravity

# Prerequisities
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install the [Processing Developement Environment](https://processing.org/)

# How the program works

1. Click anywhere on the screen and a ball will appear and move in a random direction.
2. You can add as many balls as you want
